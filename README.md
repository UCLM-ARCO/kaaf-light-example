# KAAF
In a nutshell, KAAF aims to be a system capable of processing information and knowledge about how the world works (user habits, general facts like _fire burns_, etc.), general human intentions and needs and specific contexts to, through commonsense reasoning processes, deduce, define, monitor and update the automation rules that drive the behaviour of Smart Home systems, normally defined manually by users. The name of the system is derived from a three-layered knowledge management system in which 1) **K**nowledge is defined for 2) the creation of **A**utonomous **A**utomations that determine the system functioning when 3) concrete **F**acts (that trigger the rules) are deduced from the events captured from the environment.

# What can you find in this repo
This repository shows a KAAF system in a very early stage of development. It is provided a basic implementation of KAAF for Smart Home lighting problems, as a proof of concept. The material used is the following: 

- An implementation of KAAF in Python.
- The knowledge model used to enable commonsense reasoning about lighting problems.
- A set of tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation
- Context information about a concrete scenario, the use case.
- A Home Assistant setup to visualise the automations generated by KAAF.
